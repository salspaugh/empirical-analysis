<hr>

Complete this assignment by <b>by 5PM Monday Sep 15</b>.
Turn in your answers via email to vern@cs.berkeley.edu
with the term <b>Homework</b> in the Subject.

<hr>

<p>

</p><ol type="A">

<li>Read the paper <a href="http://www.icir.org/vern/papers/meas-strategies-imc04.pdf">Strategies for Sound Internet Measurement</a>.  While the paper
is written in terms of Internet measurement in particular, nearly all of
the principles it frames also apply to more general empirical analysis
undertakings.  Some of Section 5 will not necessarily be relevant for you,
but you may find its discussion of meta-data and longitudinal
measurement useful.
	<p>

	</p><ol>
	<li>If there were networking-related parts that you found
		hampered your understanding of the points being
		made, please sketch them.
	<p>
	</p></li><li>How long did it take you to read the paper?
	<p>
	</p></li><li>Do you have any questions or comments about the paper?
	</li></ol>
	<p>

</p></li><li>If needed, (re)familiarize yourself with the workings of
	<tt>traceroute</tt>, a tool very widely used to measure the
	routes that individual messages ("packets") take through the Internet.
	<br>
	If you have questions about its operation (which may come up
	later as you work on part C), feel free to post them to Piazza.
	<p>
	If you haven't used <tt>traceroute</tt> before, you might
	find it useful to play with it.  It should be available on
	any Unix system.

</p></li><li>Download the <a href="http://www.icir.org/vern/cs294-105/data/routing-measurements.tgz">routing measurements</a> dataset.  Note that it expands to
about 28K files totaling 110 MB.
<p>

	This dataset consists of <tt>traceroute</tt> measurements
	repeatedly conducted between a set of Internet hosts.
	The point of the measurements was to obtain a representative
	view on the behavior of Internet routing, with one key
	question (though not the only one) being to what degree
	are routes <b>stable</b>, i.e., the route stays unchanged
	for a lengthy period of time.
	</p><p>
	The measurement methodology included pairing the measurements:
	that is, when conducting a measurement from A to B, at the same
	time also conduct one from B to A.

	</p><p>
	Note, this is actual data from a large-scale measurement study,
	presented in its entirety (other than I left out a number of
	additional measurements that used somewhat differing methodologies).

	</p><p>
	A typical measurement looks something like:
		</p><pre><code>traceroute to frog.rhic.bnl.gov (130.199.90.96), 30 hops max, 40 byte packets

 1  199.94.220.1  2.209 ms  1.927 ms  1.872 ms
 2  192.52.71.11  5.002 ms  2.333 ms  2.342 ms
 3  192.233.149.202  3.468 ms  4.128 ms  3.038 ms
 4  192.233.95.2  3.622 ms  4.832 ms  3.865 ms
 5  134.55.9.1  13.528 ms  13.458 ms  13.654 ms
 6  192.12.15.1  15.681 ms  17.251 ms  14.912 ms
 7  130.199.137.224  13.926 ms  14.453 ms  16.609 ms
 8  130.199.90.96  15.518 ms  14.52 ms  14.101 ms</code> </pre>
		That is, a first line describing the measurement
		being conducted, a blank line, and then a list
		of each of the hops in the measured route,
		with an Internet ("IP") address like <tt>199.94.220.1</tt>
		followed by 3 time measurements corresponding to
		the time it took to receive back the 3 probes sent
		to that hop.  Each numbered hop represents one
		step closer along the route towards the destination
		(which appears in the final hop) and away from the
		source.  (Note that the first hop is not the source
		but a "router" to which the source has a direct
		connection.)
<p>

	</p><ol>
	<li>Summarize the most basic properties of the dataset.
		(I'm again leaving this vague so you can reflect on
		what you think constitutes those basic properties.)
		Your answer here should be fairly brief.
	<p>

	</p></li><li>In what ways do some of the measurements differ from the "typical"
		measurement mentioned above?  For each qualitatively
		different way:
		<p>
		</p><ol type="A">
		<li>Describe how to detect or otherwise recognize the differing
			measurements.
		<p>
		</p></li><li>Quantify how often they appear in the dataset,
			or explain why doing so would take quite a bit of work.
		<p>
		</p></li><li>Do you believe the difference represents an actual
			phenomenon pertaining to the route being measured,
			or instead a <em>measurement artifact</em>?
			Explain why.
		</li></ol>
		<p>

	</p></li><li>For the previous question, briefly sketch your approach
		to finding such different measurements.  Does it leave
		you confident that you likely found (nearly) all of
		the different ways that the measurements manifest
		as something other than the "typical" pattern?
		<p>

	</p></li><li><b>Optional</b> and <b>Hard</b>: if you're interested in
		working with the data further, investigate what conclusions
		you can draw from the measurements regarding the stability of
		Internet routes.  Do they indeed remain unchanged for
		significant periods of time?  Be sure to clearly describe
		your methodology for conducting the analysis.
		<p>

	</p></li><li>How much time did you spend on this assignment?
		<p>

	</p></li><li>What additional data or meta-data did you find you wished
		this dataset had included (if any)?
		<p>

	</p></li><li>(Optional:) Any comments on the assignment?  Was it
		illuminating/frustrating/fun/boring?  What would
		improve it?
	</li></ol>
