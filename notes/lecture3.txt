reflections on last lecture:
- the point is not just about clock errors but how do you systematically think about your measurements

Q-Q plots
- plot Nth percentile of statistical distribution versus Nth percentile for your empirical data for all possible N
- this can reveal different modes where the fit is not exact

"all models are wrong; some models are useful"

Poisson process
- essence is memory-less arrivals at rate lambda
- great because it's mathematically tractable

tricks for trying to match distributions
- plot log X versus log of desired
- plot 1 - X versus expected desired

how to check for independence?
- correlate X, Y = ro(X,Y) = E[(X-ux)(Y-uy)] / sigmax sigmay
- this gives you a sense of how things are coupled
- timeseries Ui : interarrival of ith user => check autocorrelation
- autocorrelation = cor(Ui, Ui+k) especially k=1 (k is lag)
- how do you know if the value resultant matters?
    - generate stuff you know has no autocorrelation (e.g., shuffle interarrivals) and then compute the correlation of that
    - can do this many times and kind of get a p-value that way
