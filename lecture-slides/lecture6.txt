shankari presentation notes
- include data summary in presentation in terms of numbers of records, etc.
- works very well to surprise the audience but shankari tipped hand by showing interleaving before showing backwards jumps and that shows data's craziness
- label axes on graphs!
- don't use weird hard-to-read colors
- throw out "bad" data
- figure out when to go back to the data provider and verify your findings about data issues
- use simple tools for double-checking things
- check for things that could violate the laws of physics
- check for modes of behavior
- how to check for time independent v homogenous poisson
-- can check for non-homogeneity if you have a clear model for different modes e.g., weekday v weekend
-- check arrival rate over various bucket sizes and see if it changes

pablo presentation notes
- anytime there is derivable data in the data set you should derive it to check to make sure everything agrees
